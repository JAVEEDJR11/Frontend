        <img src="../Asserts/images/tajmahl.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            The name "Taj Mahal" is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from 
            Arabic and Persian, with the words tāj mahall meaning "crown" (tāj) "palace"
            (mahall).[4][5][6] Abdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 Padshahnama, 
            refers to the Taj Mahal as rauza-i munawwara (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, 
            rawdah-i munawwarah), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[7] The name 
            "Taj" might have been derived from the corruption of the second syllable of              "Mumtaz".

        <p>
            The history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built 
            by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC)[1] and Warring
            States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China,
            Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against
            incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, 
            constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of
            southern Manchuria.

        <p>
            Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the
            Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) 
            and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The
            site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles 
            seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern 
            Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to 
            have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central 
            Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these 
            non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.

        <p>
            The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as
            the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old 
            Kingdom. Built c. 2600 BC,[3] over a period of about 26 years,[4] the pyramid 
            is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder 
            that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza 
            pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and 
            its Necropolis".[5] It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the
            three main pyramids at Giza.

        <p>
            The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo])
            is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, 
            just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever
            built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite
            its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72
            [1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).
            [2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).
            [3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian 
            dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre 
            (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) 
            by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name
            (Flavius).

            Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; ‹See Tfd›Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"),
            originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ 
            or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō),[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city in southern 
            Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also
            called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved.
            [5] The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage 
            Site.

            Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian
            Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de 
            Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built 
            by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French 
            engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face.
            Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, 
            excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.
            It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.Christ the Redeemer differs 
            considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with 
            a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers 
            originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the 
            arms spread out wide.
